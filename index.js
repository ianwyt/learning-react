/*
Challenge: Starting from scratch, build and render the 
HTML for our section project. Check the Google slide for 
what you're trying to build.

We'll be adding styling to it later.

Hints:
* The React logo is a file in the project tree, so you can
  access it by using `src="./react-logo.png" in your image
  element
* You can also set the `width` attribute of the image element
  just like in HTML. In the slide, I have it set to 40px

        <h3>Reasons I love React</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>It's composable</li>
            <li>It's declarative</li>
            <li>It's a hireable skill</li>
            <li>It's actively maintained by skilled people</li>
